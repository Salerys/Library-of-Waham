                The next moment the heavy double doors of the throne hall opened.
                A woman in simple yet elegant clothes walked in, with a thick, unique-looking book in her hand.
                <br>
                <em>"It is too early to lose all hope."</em> she said.
                <br>
                <em>"And you, who might you be?"</em> one of the kings asked.
                <br>
                <em>"No outsiders are allowed in this gathering, state your origin!"</em>
                <br>
                With an emotionless smile she opened her mouth, slowly walking towards the gathering table.
                <br>
                <em>"I don't belong anywhere. I am but a humble being recording the history of this world."</em>
                <br>
                <em>"What nonsense is th-"</em>
                <br>
                But before the king could finish his sentence, the oracle yelled up.
                <em>"Impossible! Are you.. from Waham?!"</em>

                He couldn't leave an abandoned child on their own.
                According to him, the boy was rag and bones, wandering aimlessly in the jungle, fated to either starve to death or end
                up as monster food.
                You see, when I asked him why did he train the child so strictly, he gave me an interesting answer.
                <br>
                <em>'That boy.. he said one day he wants to fight by my side.'</em>
                <br>
                Well, guess what, he achieved it.
                He got powerful enough to stand by his father's side no matter who the opponent was."
                Ria was visibly processing all the information for a few minutes.
                <br>
                "He must have been really proud of his son" she quietly muttered.
                <br>
                <em>"He sure was. More than anything."</em> Salerys answered in a bittersweet voice.

                On top of a mountain stood the ruins of a once proud castle.
                The millenias it have withstood, the world it has overseen but are pointless remnants of the past.
                <br>
                Looking down one could only see the gaping abyss, as if the mountain top along the
                castle just existed there, waiting to be engulfed by the nothingness.
                In the distance the sun was seemingly settling. In truth, it was also being absorbed by the nothingness.
                Simple as it sounds, the end of the world.
                <br>
                Suddenly a deep, slow crackle could be heard, and another part of the mountain top crumbled into nothingness.
                As if he didn't even care, the man standing on the veranda looked in the distance with emotionless eyes, as if he was
                trying to pay attention to the sunset.
                <br>
                The last one of the world.
